# Request fulfillment

## April 28th 2025

For now I've added a stub `shop` Python module.

It seems appropriate to me to just write a simple
application to use as a wrapper specifically
for the request.

I'm probably gonna call the application
`mysterious-shop`.

Having to fill and send the request's completion in
a form on a transient web page without knowing
the exact deadline and if and when the address
could become invalid kinda gives me some anxiety
given my current work schedule,
so since no specific request seems to have been made
to keep any of the information regarding this
assessment private I think I will just make this
repository public while redacting the identity of
the involved parties and immediately send the request.
