# *\*Redacted\** assessment interview

This repository contains the work associated
to the
[assessment request](
  request.md)
by *\*redacted\** in regard to the
*\*redacted\** contractor role.

Request fulfillment log is at
[this page](
  request-fulfillment.md).

Development diary is at this
[other page](
  development-diary.md).

Completion may happen over a set of
work sessions instead than on a single one
as I'm currently employed as a teacher
in an institute geographically
far from where I reside, thus imposing
quite a strict sets of constraint over my
time schedules, so that for example
now it's currently midnight, I've just
woken up and I have to get out at 4am.

Also I'm sorry in advance for some
eventual quirkness as it's probably 3 or 4 years
I don't write Python code which is supposed to be
universally nice to read.
